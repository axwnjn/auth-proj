# Authentication (Practice Project)

This project was built to practice understanding **user authentication** using **Node.js, Express, Passport.js, and PostgreSQL**.  
The initial structure came from a Udemy course, but the implementation of logic (login, password hashing, sessions, OAuth setup) was done by me as practice.
